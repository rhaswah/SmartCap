# SmartCap
This work is for an IPRO project to create a smart cap for prescription pill bottles. Key features: reminder/alert system, tracking times opened, possibly a mic/speaker system, and the possibilities are endless.

The void loop checks if power is on or off. If it's on, ping is called.
The ping function sends 3 successive alert signals (can be light, vibration, or beep) in a row.
